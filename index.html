	<p>Hello, my name is Valentin, you can find me online as vozer or vdozer. I'm a student in Turkey and I'm currently taking Harvard's CS50 course. I can code in C and I have some HTML/CSS knowledge but I prefer to make my website minimal (since its running on a Raspberry Pi), I'm also currently learning Common Lisp and I'm planning on learning other Lisp dialects, as far as human languages I'm fluent in Turkish and English, I read, write and speak Russian at a basic level and I used to study Latin but I haven't had the time recently. I'm the author of the <a href="https://github.com/vdozer/Civitas-Public-License">Civitas Public License</a> (CPL), a license which allows software to be used for non-commercial purposes. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/vdozer">Github</a> or <a href="https://x.com/vdozerr">Twitter/X</a>. You can contact me at <b>vdozer [at] tuta [dot] com</b>.</p>

	<p>Recently I've been looking into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima">Yukio Mishima</a>, I must say he appears to be quite the interesting character. I've started reading his book named "Sun and Steel" but I haven't had the chance to look into it in detail, I've been into working out my body and I've been into philosophy for even longer so I think it would be interesting to learn about.</p>
